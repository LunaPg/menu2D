# menu2D
Easy way to generate menu in Unity


Concept : Having a small module to generate menu super fast for proto or gamejam.
Like Pause menu or Character sheet.

2 Modes will be available
1) options : Modify options in your game, display mode available
2) display: display data, options mode disable.

Everything should be Unit tested to backup devs on adding feature
